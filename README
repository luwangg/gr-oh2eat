This GNU Radio module is a collection of random small blocks for things
I always seem to need but can't find in the standard blocks.
Another purpose of the block is to let me learn more about GNU Radio.
I couldn't find a good name for this module. Since every programmer probably
has their own module like this, I decided to just name it by my ham callsign
to avoid name collisions.
